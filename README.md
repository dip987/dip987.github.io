# Welcome!
This is Rishad Raiyan. I am a PhD student at the University of California, Davis working under [Prof. Soheil Ghiasi](https://www.ece.ucdavis.edu/~soheil/). We are currently working on a handheld device for sensing fetal oxygenation levels through the maternal abdomen using continuous wave near-infrared spectroscopy (CWNIRS) during pregnancy. For more information, visit the [TFO project](https://lepsucd.com/transabdominal-fetal-oximetry/) homepage. 

My contributions include photon transport/Monte Carlo simulations on idealized tissue models which guide the team's design efforts. I also work with various digital signal processing and machine learning algorithms applied to real-life data gathered by our probes.  

In my free time, I tinker around with electronics, IoT devices and some cross-platform app development.
